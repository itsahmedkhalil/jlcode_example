# jlcode_example
Example of the use of jlcode to write Julia code in LaTeX

The `example.tex` file provides a template.

The `example.pdf` is an example output file.

Test it with:

```
git clone https://github.com/m3g/jlcode_example
cd jlcode_example
make
```

Currently it requires `lualatex` installed for a proper handling of unicode characters. The `Makefile` uses `latexmk` for rendering.
